🧠 Face Detection Using OpenCV
A computer vision project that detects human faces from images using Haar cascade classifiers in OpenCV.

This repository includes:

* Preprocessing of input images
* Implementation of face detection using Haar cascades
* Display of output images with detected faces
* Sample output images

⚙️ Features
✅ Detects human faces in static images using OpenCV
🖼️ Processes multiple sample images automatically
📸 Outputs face-detected images for visualization
💡 Easy to expand to real-time detection or video

📁 Project Structure
face\_detect.py — Main face detection script

/requirements.txt — Dependencies

/images — Contains all test input images

/outputs — Output images with detected faces

/haarcascade\_frontalface\_default.xml — Haar cascade XML file for face detection

🧠 Tech Stack
Python 3.7+ – Programming language
OpenCV – Image processing and face detection
NumPy – Image array handling and operations
Matplotlib – (Optional) for plotting outputs

🚀 How to Run the Project
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

Step 1: Clone the Repository

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)

cd your-repo-name

Step 2: Install the Required Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 3: Run the Main Script

python face\_detect.py

Step 4: Output

The script will:

* Load the Haar cascade face detector
* Read each image from the images/ directory
* Detect faces and draw bounding boxes
* Save output images with boxes into the outputs/ folder
