# 🧠 Face Detection Using OpenCV

A computer vision project that detects human faces in images using OpenCV’s Haar Cascade Classifier.

This repository includes:

- Pre-trained Haar Cascade XML files for frontal face detection
- A Python script to process images and detect faces
- Sample input and output images for demonstration
- Folder structure for storing datasets, results, and documentation
